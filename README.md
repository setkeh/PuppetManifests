# PuppetManifests
My Puppet manifests for configuring nodes.


Things TODO:
-------------
Need to add Hiera to take usernames and ssh_keys out of the config.

If you add my SSH keys to your server dont forget to pm me their IP's :P


Things and Stuff:
-----------------
All site wide config should go in sites/ directory sites.pp will automatically include all manifests in this DIR
